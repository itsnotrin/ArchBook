## What is Archbook?

It's capable of running on many devices and is designed to be as light as possible with instructions given to make it even faster / lighter than stock.

It will work on older Chromebooks as well as any device and is designed to be a breath of fresh air for anybody looking for a new distro to try or just looking to start with linux!
