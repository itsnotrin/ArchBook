## What is Archbook?

This is an OS designed to grant some similarity to users of ChromeOS whilst offering the advantages of Linux.

It's capable of running on many devices and is designed to be as light as possible with instructions given to make it even faster / lighter than stock.

It will work on older Chromebooks as well as any device and is designed to be a breath of fresh air for anybody looking for a new distro to try or just looking to start with linux!

## What does it use?

### ðŸ’» Base OS

[ArchCraft](https://archcraft.io/)

**Why?**

It's already extremely optimised and works out of the box on all the chromebooks I've tested it on very nicely!

### ðŸ“º Window Manager

[OpenBox](https://github.com/danakj/openbox)

**Why?**

It's very lightweight, popular, fast and just works nicely overall whilst still being very customisable.
